      "fullText": " One of the ways to publish and distribute your website is to use Search Engine Optimization for Search Engines to show your site to users. Making SEO involves a combination of technical and content optimization. When SEO is set up and used correctly – it could bring lots of new traffic to the web page. It is not complex to accomplish, while optimizing your website could play important part in boosting your search presence. Google receives 90% of all online searches. That’s why we’re going to talk about setting up SEO for Googling and connect to Google Search Console for detailed analysis. Inside of Google’s Search Engine Google uses crawl bots, we are going to talk more about which technologies improve how good your page is for crawlers later on. This picture from Google is going to help us understand the way Google Search Engine works. There is a difference between the Processing stage that parses HTML and Renderer stage which executes Javascript. This was implemented and is a smart move from Google because Javascript is expensive and Googlebots need to look at over hundreds of trillion webpages. So it parses HTML immediately and puts Javascript in queue to run it later. That is a reason, why Google prefer different types of modern technologies more, than old ones. Let's talk more about this. Here are some steps to set up SEO perfectly: 1. Content optimization This is important step from the whole Search Engine Optimization perspective. Create high-quality, informative, and engaging content that your target audience is looking for, using your chosen keywords in a natural and strategic way. Researching and selecting the most relevant and valuable keywords for your website would improve the way Search Engines treat your page. Because it helps find relative content to the user, and ease the load on Google Servers to get the right information from the user's input. 2. On-page optimization Optimizing your website's title tags, meta descriptions, URLs, image \"alt\" tags and header tags will make it easy for search engines to understand what your site is about. Search Engine Optimization needs help setting up, so we need to align our code accordingly. In <head> section of our page, we can use <meta> tag to directly tell Google how to understand and treat our page. Description Note that description has to be unique. <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipsing elit. Aliquam ac purus elit. In magna nisi, pulvinar et commodo vitae, elefiend in est. Sed eget diam metus\" /> Where name tells to put it in description section of Google Search and content is a text of meta tag: Google will crawl your page, and if description of a page is absent or Googlebot finds it very common (could be used in any other webpage, isn’t unique), it is going to ignore the tag and find relative text inside of a page to use and show it instead. This behaviour can be disabled: <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noodp,noydir\" /> These are instructions to search engines not to use information from web directories when showing your site in the search results. Icon Uploading web application icon to this service will help optimizing it for different sizes and types of devices. Additional: Google Search Engine is a smart machine, but many times it confuses what is the website’s main picture is, so we can help Google understand your site better. Setting up a Schema for structured data is going to be a solution. These are now <script> tags and they go to <head> section as well. For example, this would help Google identify which is the desired image for current page, so it could show it next time your page appears in search. If primary image is absent or incorect Google will try to find relavant picture inside the page to show for specific search, regardless - that is why this might be important part. Where primaryImageOfPage is a link to the Logo or Primary . To Show Frequently Asked Question in Google. It might be good thought to tell your FAQ of page directly to Google so it could show it next time with appropriate request from user. 3. Technical optimization Ensure that website is technically sound - meaning that it is fast, mobile-friendly, and has a clean and organized code structure. Good to know that Google has a limited resources for each web application – that’s why the app that has too many pages with different content and use lots of javascript – could end up Google reading only a part of the app’s content. Google has a guide for managing your crawl budget here. Using CDN GoogleBots also look at how long it takes to load webpage, so it ranks it up accordingly. Content Delivery Network (CDN) is going to take the workload down, since it’s not the actual code that’s heave to load, but mostly the images and additional libraries that can be loaded from servers that are closer to the user. Unnecessary code Page should not execute any additional code that is not essential for page. At least doing it later, when user is using the app. Loading code asynchronously will speed up the app's loading time. Using KISS and YAGNI principles while developing an app also would help. There is a great tool to info the website speed loading time. 4. New Technologies Frameworks like NextJS are one of the best solutions for SEO and GoogleBots to crawl since the content is loaded using the SSR (server-side rendering). This approach enables the server to render the app and send the rendered version to the user already, while other Javascript code loads in the background. Sounds pretty good, right? While search engines will receive HTML directly from the server and doesn’t need generating HTML while crawling. 5. Link building Building links to your website from other reputable websites can help boost your site's authority and ranking. This can even be monitored through Google Search Console, in Links tab - List of website's that has linked your page somewhere. More steps: 6. Monitor and analyze Tools such as Google Analytics and Google Search Console will give opportunity to monitor your website's perfomance and identify areas for improvement. 7. Principles We should use these principles to understand the way Google ranks our page and align our site in favor: It should be quick to load the page (Using CDN) It should not execute any code that’s not essential for page. User should use the site as soon as it is possible. Roughly, it is referred to the following: Time To Interactive (TTI), the time at which a page becomes interactive (user can scroll, click, etc.) Time to First Bite (TTFB), the time to receive the first bite of content after clicking a link Size of Bundle, total bytes of code downloaded and executed before showing a page to user. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), how long it takes for the Largest Content Element to be visible within visitor’s viewport. Conclusion Google Search is a powerful tool for users to discover requested sources of information, Google found smart ways to rank up different websites and surely most of the time Google needs our help setting up different less or more important things for our site for our own benefit. Remember that SEO is an onging process and requires ongoing effort and optimization to achieve and maintain high rankings in search engines. "

      "fullText": "Website security is crucial for any business that operates online, regardless of its size or industry. Secure website creates strong connection between the users/audience because trust is one of the main ingredients of successful entity, whether online or offline. Protecting confidential dataYour website may store sensitive information such as customer data, financial information, and business secrets. If that information falls into the wrong hands, it not only going to have effect on the customers, but can have severe consequences for your business as well. Building trustCustomers expect your website to be secure when they share their personal information with you. A secure website helps build trust with your customers, which is crucial for customer retention and business growth. Maintaining brand reputationA security breach can have severe consequences for your business reputation. If your website is hacked, it can result in a loss of trust, negative publicity, and even legal actions. Protecting against downtimeA website breach can result in downtime, which can be costly for your business Downtime can lead to lost revenue, decreased productivity, and damage to your brand reputation. First few steps to ensure secure website1. Keep your software up-to-datePlease, make sure to keep your website software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. Including the CMS (Content Management System), plugins, and themes. Hackers and cybercriminals are always looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unathorized access to websites and their valuable data. By keeping software up-to-date you can help prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited and reduce the risk of a security breach. Additionally, outdated software can also cause compatibility issues and impact the perfomance of a website. 2. Using HTTPS and SSL/TLSSecuring a website with HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt data transmission between the server and the client. HTTPS is especially important for websites that handle sensitive user information, such as login credentials, financial data or personal information. Without HTTPS, this data can be intercepted by attackers who can use it for malicious purposes such as identity theft, fraud, or other cybercrimes. Implementing HTTPS also help build trust as discussed earlier. When users see the \"Secure\" or \"HTTPS\" label in their browser's address bar, they know that their data is being transmitted securely, which can help to increase their confidence about the website.Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts the data transmitted between the website and the users, preventing hackers from intercepting and stealing sensitive information. 3. Using secure hosting and strong passwordsChoosing a secure web hosting provider that offers features like DDoS protection, intrusion detection, and server-side scanning for malware might be a good idea. Especially when website has a lot of attention on the internet. Using strong and unique passwords not only for a hosting provider but for all the accounts will ensure indisputable security. Additional Steps4. Limit file uploadsRestrict file uploads to only allow certain file types and limit the maximum file size to prevent hackers from uploading malicious files to your server. Limiting file uploads is an essential security measure to protect your website from malware and viruses that can be uploaded by attackers. Allow only specific file types:Limit the types of files that users can upload to your website. For instance, only allow image files, PDFs, or certain document types, and block executable files, scripts, or other dangerous file types. Use file type verification:Implement server-side file type verification to ensure that only allowed file types are uploaded. Attackers may try to bypass client-side restrictions and upload malicious files by changing the file type in the request header. Limit the file size:Restrict the maximum file size that users can upload to your website. Large files can consume a lot of server resources and take longer to scan for viruses or malware. 5. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)2FA(Shutterstock) Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to the login process. 2FA is effective in preventing unauthorized access to user accounts, even if a hacker has obtained the user's login credentials. This is because the hacker would also need to have access to the second factor, which is typically something that only the legitimate user has, like their phone or email account. Implementing 2FA on your website is a relatively simple process. You can use third-party services that provide 2FA functionality, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, or you can implement your own 2FA system. Some popular CMS platforms, such as WordPress, offer built-in support for 2FA. It's important to note that while 2FA is an effective security measure, it's not foolproof. Hackers have been known to use social engineering tactics to trick users into providing both factors of authentication. ConclusionWebsite security is essential for your business' success and longevity. Securing a website is an ongoing process that involves several measures to ensure that your website and its data are safe from unauthorized access, hacking attempts, and other security threats. It protects your sensitive and valuable information, builds important trust with customers that can be damaged forever, maintains your brand reputation and protects against downtime.",

      "fullText": "A content delivery network (CDN) is a widely recognized solution that helps to improve website performance. When maintaining a website, it is eassential to keep it safe and fast-loading. To resolve these main two problems, the CDN comes in.The discussion is going to be about Content Delivery Network. What is used for, what is under the hood and more.About CDNA CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver content to users around the world.Servers are typically located in various geographic locations, allowing content to be cached closer to end-users, resulting in faster delivery of content and lower latency.(cloudflare)When a user requests content from a website or application, the CDN will direct the user's request to the closest server that has a cached copy of the content. This reduces the distance the content has to travel and highly improves the overall perfomance of the website application.CDNs are commonly used to deliver large files such as images, videos, and software downloads, as well as static content such as HTML pages and CSS files. They can also help protect websites from DDoS attack by distributing traffic across multiple servers and provdiing additional layers of securiy. More about Securing a website is in other post here.How CDN Improves PerfomanceOne of the main advantages of using a CDN is improved website speed. By caching and delivering content from the server closest to the user, a CDN reduces latency and decreases page load times, resulting in a faster and more responsive website experience.Content Delivery Network is design to bring only the best by distributing its servers across the globe.While reducing the latency and network congestion that can occur when users access content from a central server located in one physical location improves perfomance of any website.1. CachingCDN makes caching easy by storing website content on multiple servers located in different geographic regions, which can be easily accessed by users. Caching involves temporarily storing frequently accessed website content on the user's device or on the server.By doing so, subsequent requests for the same content can be served faster, improving website speed and user experience.With a CDN, website content is automatically cached on the CDN's servers when it is first accessed. When a user requests the same content again, the CDN's server closest to the user can serve the content from its cache, rather than fetching it from the website's origin server.This reduces the distance the data needs to travel, resulting in faster page load times and a smoother user experience.Moreover, a CDN's caching capabilities can be customized to suit a website's specific needs. For example, website owners can choose how long content should be cached on the CDN's servers before it expires, as well as which types of content should be cached. This can help optimize website performance and improve user experience.Additionally, CDNs can use advanced caching techniques such as dynamic caching and edge caching. Dynamic caching involves caching content that changes frequently, such as social media feeds or real-time data. Edge caching involves caching content on the CDN's servers located at the edge of the network, which are closest to the user. This can reduce latency even further, resulting in faster page load times.2. Reduced latencyReducing latency is one of the main advantages of using a CDN. Latency refers to the time it takes for a user's device to send a request to a website's server and receive a response. When latency is high, it can result in slow page load times and a poor user experience.A CDN can reduce latency by caching website content on multiple servers located in different geographic regions. When a user requests website content, the CDN's server closest to the user can serve the content from its cache, rather than fetching it from the website's origin server. This reduces the distance the data needs to travel, resulting in faster page load times and a smoother user experience.3. ScalabilityCDNs can handle large volumes of traffic without overloading the oirgin server.By distribuing the load across multiple servers, CDNs can handle sudden spikes in traffic without impacting website perfomance.4. DDoS protectionWhen a website experiences a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, it means that a large number of requests are sent to the website's server, causing it to overload and potentially crash. This can result in the website being unavailable to users, which can harm a business's reputation and revenue.One way to mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack is by using a CDN. A CDN spreads traffic across multiple servers located in different geographic regions, so when a user requests to access the website, the request is directed to the server closest to the user. This not only reduces latency and improves website speed but also ensures that traffic is spread out across multiple servers.In the event of a DDoS attack, a CDN can detect the surge in traffic and distribute it across multiple servers, which can handle the load and prevent any one server from being overwhelmed. Additionally, a CDN can filter out malicious traffic, blocking any requests that are deemed suspicious or harmful. This can help keep a website online and protect it from cyber attacks.CDNs can help protect website from DDoS attacks by spreading the traffic across multiple servers and filtering out malicious traffic.CDN also enhances website security by mitigating cyber-attacks, particularly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can cripple a website by overloading the servers. A CDN spreads traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that a website can withstand a massive traffic surge and stay online.ConclusionCDN is a powerful tool that can help businesses improve website performance, security, reliability, and save money.By using a CDN, businesses can enhance their users' experience, boost their online reputation, and increase revenue by providing fast and reliable access to their content and services.",

      "fullText": "PWAs are web applications that combine the capabilities of web technologies with the user experience of native mobile applications.Whilst using PWAs capabilities - it will retain users, not difficult to develop and more.What is Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that combine native mobile applications' user experience with capabilities of web technologies. Basically, web applications that look and feel like native mobile apps.Any device or platform that uses a standards-complaint web browser, including desktops, smartphones and tablets can be used with PWAs.In DepthThey can be installed on the user's device like a native app. Which means they can work offline or with poor internet connection.Allowing users to access content and functionalities even without the stable connection to the network is made possible through the use of Service Workers, which are scripts that run in the background and can intercept network requests, cache content, and respond to user actions even when there is no network connection.Benefits of using PWA:Overall, it offers many benefits for businesses and users alike. While becoming increasingly popular as a way to deliver mobile experiences.Increased ReachPWAs can be accessed from any device with a web browser, allowing businesses to reach a wider audience.Unlike native apps, PWAs don't require users to download and install an app from an app store, which can be a barrier to entry for some users.PWAs can also be shared easily through links or social media, making it easier for businesses to promote their products or services.It's Modern!PWAs use modern web technologies to provide reliable, engaging and fast user experience, such as:Service WorkersWeb Push NotificationsWeb App ManifestWeb App Manifests are another key component of PWAs. A manifest is a JSON file that provides information about the app, such as its name, icons, and display mode. By including a manifest in the app, developers can ensure that it looks and behaves like a native app when installed on a user's device.SEO BenefitsSince PWAs are web applications, they can be indexed by search engines, making it easier for users to find them. This can help businesses increase their visibility and drive more traffic to their website.More about SEO and How To Improve it on Your Website.Cost-effectiveDeveloping and maintaining native apps can be expensive, particularly if businesses need to create separate versions for different platforms.PWAs, on the other hand, can be built using web technologies that are widely available and well-understood, reducing development costs.PWAs can also be updated and maintained more easily than native apps, since there's no need to go through the app store approval process.Examples of Progressive Web Apps:1. UberUber's PWA offers a streamlined experience for requesting rides and tracking their progress, with features such as real-time updates and location tracking.2. FlipboardFlipboard's PWA offers a fast and engaging experience for browsing news and other content, with features such as offline mode and push notifications.3. PinterestPinterest's PWA offers a fast and engaging user experience, with features such as push notifications and an immersive full-screen mode.4. StarbucksStarbucks' PWA allows users to order ahead and pay using their mobile device, as well as providing features such as store locator and menu browsing.Final ThoughtsProgressive Web Apps are still a relatively new technology, and there are some limitations to what they can do compared to native apps.For example, they may not have access to all of the hardware features of a device, such as the camera or accelerometer.However, as the technology continues to evolve, it's likely that more and more functionality will be added to PWAs, making them an even more compelling option for developers and businesses alike.",
